JavaScript is only\nfor sugar. This makes them perfectly accessible.\n\n__Optimized for mobile:__ The modals are designed using responsive web design\nmethods. They work on all screen sizes from a small mobile phone up to high\nresolution screens.\n\n__Use as Sass plugin:__ You can use CSS Modal as [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/)\nplugin and apply it to your custom classes. No need to understand all the code.\n\n__A few other advantages:__ accessible, cross-browser, media-adaptive, small and\nfast!\n\n\n## How to use\n\nPlease visit [the website's section](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#howto-markup)\non how to use CSS Modals.\n\n\n## Browser Support\n\nThis modal is designed to work on all modern browsers. This does not include\nInternet Explorer 7 or lower.\n\n\n## Heads up\n\nPlease be aware that you need to stop playing videos or audio manually after\nhiding the modal.\n\nThere is an event `cssmodal:show` fired on the modal itself after the modal is\nshown. Another event `cssmodal:hide` is fired after the modal is hidden.\n\nThere events are not fired in IE8. Please be aware of that and use jQuery or\nsomething else to create custom events.\n\n\n## Bug reports and feature requests\n\nIf you got something that's worth including into the project please\n[open an issue](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/issues) for further\ndiscussion.\n\nPlease see the [section on contributing](http://drublic.github.io/css-modal/#contributing)\non the website.\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nThis is a project by [Hans Christian Reinl](http://drublic.de). Thanks goes out\nto [all other contributors](https://github.com/drublic/css-modal/contributors).\n",
